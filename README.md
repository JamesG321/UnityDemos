# UnityDemos

This repository is a collection of various demo projects for Unity that I made, aimed to be easy-to-understand examples of various functionalites in Unity, with scripts that can be taken and used off-the-shelf.

## Click and drag demo
![Click and drag thumbnail](https://github.com/JamesG321/UnityDemos/blob/master/Images%20for%20documents/click%20and%20drag%20thumbnail.png)
This is a demo for a click and drag script that allows the user to pick up and move/drag around an object using thier mouse. Release velocity is also calculated based on how fast the user drags the object before letting go of the click. This allows the user to 'throw' around the object as well.
